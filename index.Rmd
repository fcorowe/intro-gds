# Description

This workshops offers an introduction to *Geographic Data Science*. It provides an introduction to fundamental concepts of geographic data science using a hands-on approach in *R*. It offers an overview of various types of spatial data, key challenges of working with these data, and some basic analytical techniques. 

# Structure

The workshop is structured as follows:

* [*What is geographic data science?*]()
* [**Spatial data**]()  
* [**Spatial weights**]()  
* [**Spatial autocorrelation**]()  

# Philosophy

* Focus on **methods** and tools
  - General overview
  - Intuition
  - Very little math 
  - Opportunities to continue on your own
* Emphasis on the **application** and **use**
* Focus on **real-world** applications

# Resources

All this course material is available on Github and you can download it [**here**](https://github.com/fcorowe/udd_gds_course/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Once you have download it, ensure it is in a safe place on your computer.

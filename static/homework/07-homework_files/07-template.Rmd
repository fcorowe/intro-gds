## Class

Reopen your `vis-for-gds` project and save this `.Rmd` to the `reports` folder. When working through the materials from this session run each code chunk separately by clicking the small green arrow beside each code chunk. By default I have set `eval=FALSE` on most code chunks, so when you knit the code chunk will not execute.

The technical element to this session demonstrates how linear regression models can be updated with Fixed Effects and Interaction Terms. Approaches for extracting model summaries and diagnostics introduced in the previous session will be used again.

### Setup

The code block below points to the packages you need to do the work discussed in the session. Uncomment the `intall_packages()` lines if you have not already downloaded `tidymodels`.

```{r setup, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # Bundle of packages for doing modern data analysis.
library(sf) # Spatial operations
library(here) # For navigating project directory

library(parlitools) # Contains required data.
# install.packages("tidymodels") # Uncomment for download.
library(tidymodels) # For working with model outputs.
```

### Import

I assume that you have saved the data from the previous session Run the code block below to download and process the data required for this session. If not, the code for generating it is below -- the key dataset is `data_for_models`.

```{r collect-data, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load constituency boundaries, simplified using mapshapr
url <- "https://www.roger-beecham.com/datasets/cons_outline.geojson"
cons_outline <- st_read(url, crs=27700)

# Collect explanatory variables (from census_11 table in parlitools)
explanatory <- census_11 %>%
  transmute(
    ons_const_id=ons_const_id, constituency_name=constituency_name, region=region,
    population=population, population_density=population_density,
    younger=age_20_to_24+age_25_to_29+age_30_to_44,
    own_home=house_owned,
    no_car=cars_none, white=ethnicity_white_british+ethnicity_white_irish,eu_born=born_other_eu, christian,
    professional=nssechigher_manager+nssechigher_professional, degree=qual_level_4,
    not_good_health=health_fair+health_bad+health_very_bad, heavy_industry=industry_manufacturing+industry_transport
    )

  # Collect outcome variable (from leave_votes_west table in parlitools)
  outcome <- leave_votes_west %>%
    select(ons_const_id, constituency_name, leave=figure_to_use) %>%
    inner_join(explanatory %>% select(ons_const_id, region)) %>%
    mutate(gb_leave=.519, resid_unform=leave-gb_leave)

# Z-score transform explanatory variables.
explanatory_z_scores <- explanatory %>%
  mutate(
    across(
      .cols=c(younger:heavy_industry), .funs=~(.x-mean(.x))/sd(.x)
    )
  )

# Generate data frame containing data for models.
data_for_models <- explanatory_z_scores %>%
  inner_join(outcome %>% select(ons_const_id, leave, region))
```

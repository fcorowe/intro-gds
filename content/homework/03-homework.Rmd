## Session Outcomes

By the end of this homework session you should be able to:

{{% callout objective %}}
- [x] Formally describe data graphics according to their visual encoding.
- [x] Reproduce graphics by writing `ggplot2` specifications.
- [x] Combine `dplyr` and conditional statements to prep data for plotting.
{{% /callout %}}

## Introduction

This homework requires you to apply the concepts and skills developed in the class session on [visualization fundamentals](/class/03-class/). Do complete each of the tasks and be sure to save your work as this homework will be submitted as part of your portfolio for Assignment 1.

## Task 1: Describe and evaluate

```{r spoke-map, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Map of Butler Con-Lab Swing in 2019 General Election.", out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("/class/03-class_files/spoke-map.png", error = FALSE)
```

Complete the description table below identifying each **data item** that is encoded along with its **measurement level**, **visual mark** and **visual channel**  and the effectiveness rank, according to @munzner_visualization_2014, of this encoding.

| Data item      | Measurement level | Visual mark      | Visual channel  | Rank         |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| `location`     | <enter here>      |  <enter here>    | <enter here>    | <enter here> |
| `...`          |`...`              |  `...`           | `...`           | `...`        |
| `...`          |`...`              |  `...`           | `...`           | `...`        |
| `...`          |`...`              |  `...`           | `...`           | `...`        |
| `...`          |`...`              |  `...`           | `...`           | `...`        |
| `...`          |`...`              |  `...`           | `...`           | `...`        |


## Task 2: Reproduce


### Histograms faceted by region

Write some code for reproducing something similar to the graphic below -- a set of histograms of the Swing variable, faceted by region. Place your code into the [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> 03-template.Rmd](/homework/03-homework_files/03-template.Rmd) file for this session.

```{r hist-region-code, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#######################
# Enter your code in the chunk provided.
######################
```

* [Save your plot](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html#saving-your-plots) as a `.png` file and insert the file as a Figure into your `.Rmd` document ([guidance here](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/figures-tables-captions-.html)).

```{r hist-region, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Histograms of Swing variable, grouped by region.", out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("/class/03-class_files/hist-region.png", error = FALSE)
```

### Scatterplots with multiple encodings

Write some code for reproducing something similar to the graphic below -- a scatterplot comparing 2017 and 2019 vote shares for Labour. Be sure to include **every** encoding as it appears in the graphic (e.g. `shape` and `alpha` according to whether constituencies flipped allegiance). Hint: you may need to use a **conditional statement** to generate a variable for emphasising constituencies that flipped parties between 2017 and 2019. Place your code into the [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> 03-template.Rmd](/homework/03-homework_files/03-template.Rmd) file for this session.

```{r scatters-code, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#######################
# Enter your code in the chunk provided.
######################
```

* [Save your plot](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html#saving-your-plots) as a `.png` file and insert the file as a Figure into your `.Rmd` document ([guidance here](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/figures-tables-captions-.html)).


```{r scatters-lab, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Plots of 2019 versus 2017 vote shares.", out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("/class/03-class_files/scatters-lab.png", error = FALSE)
```

## Task 3: Create a map

Write some code for reproducing something similar to the graphic below -- a map of the estimated Leave:Remain vote margin by Parliamentary Constituency. Note that I am using a [diverging](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&scheme=BrBG&n=3) colour scheme here to distinguish whether the Constituency was majority Leave and Remain  -- brown or green -- and also the *size* of that majority -- the darker the colour, the larger the majority.

 Place your code into the [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> 03-template.Rmd](/homework/03-homework_files/03-template.Rmd) file for this session.

```{r map-code, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#######################
# Enter your code in the chunk provided.
######################
```

* [Save your plot](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html#saving-your-plots) as a `.png` file and insert the file as a Figure into your `.Rmd` document ([guidance here](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/figures-tables-captions-.html)).


```{r referendum-map, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Map of 2016 EU Referendum vote, estimated by Parliamentary Constituency in GB.", out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("/class/03-class_files/referendum-map.png", error = FALSE)
```

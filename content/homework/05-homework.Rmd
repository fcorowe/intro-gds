## Session Outcomes

By the end of this homework session you should be able to:

{{% callout objective %}}
- [x] Interpret non-standard data graphics by 'looking-up' specific values/trends.
- [x] Infer patterns from non-standard data graphics.
{{% /callout %}}

## Introduction

This homework requires you to apply the concepts and skills developed in the class session on [exploring spatial networks](/class/05-class/). Do complete the task and be sure to save your work as it will be submitted as part of your portfolio for Assignment 1.

## Visualization interpretation challenge

You may be pleased to know that this week's homework does not require you to write a single line of code. Instead, it is designed to get you reading and interpreting data graphics. [OD Maps](https://xeno.graphics/od-map/) are a good candidate here as they have been catalogued by [Marteen Lambrechts](https://www.maartenlambrechts.com) as a Xenographic -- *Weird but (sometimes) useful*. I'd add that within the list of other [Xenographics](https://xeno.graphics), OD Maps are *Not that weird and often useful*. Nevertheless, they do take some interpretation.


```{r mode-analysis-od-map, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="OD map of commutes between London boroughs", fig.align="left", out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("/class/05-class_files/od-maps-mode-homework.png", error = FALSE)
```
###  Task 1: Read

For a clear explanation of OD maps and interesting application, read @slingsby_od_2014's very short paper: [*OD maps for showing changes in Irish female migration between 1851 and 1911*](https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/8483/).

### Task 2: Interpret

Considering the OD maps in Figure \@ref(fig:mode-analysis-od-map), try to answer the following tasks. Write your answers in the  [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> 05-template.Rmd](/homework/04-homework_files/05-template.Rmd) file.

#### Look-up tasks

* For jobs filled in the City of London (CTY), from which borough does largest number of workers commute using public transport?
  + *Enter your answer in the template*
* Which borough in London has the largest *absolute* number living and working in that borough (and travelling to work by public transport)?
  + *Enter your answer in the template*
* For workers living in Barnet (BRN), what are the top 3 boroughs to which they commute?
  + *Enter your answer in the template*


#### Insights

Identify three isights that can be made around the geography of commuting patterns in London from reading any/each of the graphics in Figure \@ref(fig:mode-analysis-od-map). Briefly identify which graphic(s) led to the insight and how. Please do not spend too long over this activity -- the idea is to encourage you to make inferences from graphics, as you will do in your coursework.

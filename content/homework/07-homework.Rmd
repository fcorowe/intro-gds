## Session Outcomes

There is no formal homework session this time. You may wish to consult [these sessions](https://www.roger-beecham.com/data-science-practicals/) on Geographically-Weighted statistics that uses the [`GWModel`](http://gwr.maynoothuniversity.ie/) to explore how associations with Leave vary continuously over space.
